# Spotify-Clone
Welcome to the SpotifyClone repository! This project aims to recreate the frontend and user experience of the popular music streaming service, Spotify, within a web-based platform. This project was designed to improve my skills in front-end web development, I used HTML and CSS to design and style the interface, and I implemented JavaScript to handle the sliding for music cards. This README file will provide you an overview of the project and contribution guidelines.

Technologies Used
